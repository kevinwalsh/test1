
QUICK SETUP GUIDE:

**	1) downloads:
I had a 64 bit eclipse (prob not too relevant yet) so I D/L'd 64 bit tortoiseSVN

install that whatever way (I think i should have installed extra icons to look nicer). and then it should be ready to go/ always running, at least in windows explorer.


**	2) To "export" files/ download from a repository:

rightclick "tortoiseSVN -> export"



**	3) to link to a repository (for easy sync/ commit):
rightclick "SVN checkout"
From here, new options will appear:
(a) "SVN Update" to download the latest committed version from repository. (NB always do this first incase you overwrite later versions!)
(b) "SVN commit" to save all your latest changes as the most up-to-date revision of the code base.



**	4) Creating a repository:
can create an online one quite easily via github. 
-go to homepage, click repositories tab, & click "new". choose a name, & description if needed. MUST be public with github free.
-(initialising a readme is kinda pointless since its a weird file (readme.md).)

-then to link to this repository, use the http address. (e.g. https://github.com/kevinwalsh/test1)


-OR for a local repository, go to desired local [EMPTY] folder, and click "TortoiseSVN -> create repository here"
note that this folder must be currently EMPTY, and not write-protected!

GLOSSARY:

"SVN Checkout" = essentially get/download latest working copy of project, to work on it. select a repository, and it will be copied to your selected/ current directory.

**"import" = actually uploads a file TO the repository!!! 
	(I kinda assumed it would download FROM....)

"export" = counterintuitive, but grabs all files FROM a repository for use.
	-> NB usually does to a subfolder, but if necessary, it will write to wherever AND WILL OVERWRITE any duplicate files!!
